"""Authoritative account state, immune to settings-dialog snapshot saves.

Kodi's add-on settings dialog snapshots every value when it opens and saves
that snapshot back when it closes - including across a RunScript launched from
a <close>true</close> button. Anything a script writes to settings can
therefore be silently reverted by a dialog the user still has in play
(observed live: a passed Test Connection reverting to a stale 401 state).

Test Connection writes the truth HERE (single writer, atomic replace); the
background service mirrors this file back into settings whenever a dialog
save drifts them. Settings are just the display cache.
